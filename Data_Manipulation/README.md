In this folder we have a notebook for each car brand.

The data obtained by Web Scraping are manipulated and transformed so that they have the appropriate format to be used and exploited by Machine Learning algorithms.

We start from csv files generated by Web Scraping, we form dataframes with them and we manipulate them using pandas.

Two files are generated in each notebook, named BRAND_esp and BRAND_EU. 
The first will be used to train a Machine learning algorithm and the second to search for import opportunities.

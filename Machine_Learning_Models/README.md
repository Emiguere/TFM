In this folder the variables are encoded and various Machine Learning algorithms are tested to see which of them is more accurate
to predict car prices in the Spanish second-hand car market.

The mean absolute error for all algorithms is compared, testing the car brands separately and all together.
In addition, different transformations of the variables are tested to reduce the error in the predictions.
A search for the best hyperparameters is also carried out.

Finally we reach the conclusion the best algorithm is the GradientBoostinRegressor of sklearn including all brands.
